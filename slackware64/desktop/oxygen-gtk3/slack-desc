# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

oxygen-gtk3:
oxygen-gtk3: Oxygen-Gtk3 is a port of the  default KDE widget theme (Oxygen), to
oxygen-gtk3: GTK. Its primary goal is to ensure visual consistency  between gtk
oxygen-gtk3: and qt-based applications running under KDE. A secondary objective
oxygen-gtk3: is to also have a stand-alone  nice  looking  gtk theme that would
oxygen-gtk3: behave well on other Desktop Environments.

PC/SC-lite is a middleware to access a smart card using SCard API (PC/SC)
Its purpose is to provide a Windows(R) SCard interface in a very small
form factor for communicating to smart cards and readers.

Compiling with "DEBUGATR=1 ./pcsc-lite.SlackBuild" enables ATR parsing
debug output messages.

pcsc-lite no longer uses (deprecated) libhal for smart-card reader's
detection. By default libudev is used now.

Please see README.SLACKWARE in pcsc-lite's documentation directory
for notes.

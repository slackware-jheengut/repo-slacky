# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

ufraw: UFRaw (Unidentified Flying Raw)
ufraw:
ufraw: The  Unidentified  Flying  Raw  (UFRaw)  is  a  utility  to  read  and
ufraw: manipulate raw images from digital cameras. It can be  used on its own
ufraw: or as  a Gimp plug-in. It  reads  raw images  using Dave  Coffin's raw
ufraw: conversion  utility - DCRaw.  UFRaw   supports  basic color management
ufraw: using Little CMS, allowing the user to apply color profiles. For Nikon
ufraw: users  UFRaw has  the  advantage  that it  can read  the camera's tone
ufraw: curves. Even  if  you  don't own a Nikon, you  can still apply a Nikon
ufraw: curve to your images.

# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

bibutils: Bibutils (Bibliography Formats Converter)
bibutils:
bibutils: The bibutils program set interconverts between various bibliography
bibutils: formats using a  common MODS-format  XML  intermediate. For example
bibutils: one   can   convert  RIS-format   files  to  Bibtex  by  doing  two
bibutils: transformations: RIS->MODS->Bibtex. By  using a common intermediate
bibutils: for N formats, only 2N programs are required  and  not NÂ²-N. These
bibutils: programs operate on the command line and are styled  after standard
bibutils: UNIX-like filters.

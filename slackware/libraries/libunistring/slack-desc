# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libunistring: Text files are nowadays usually encoded in Unicode, and may
libunistring: consist of very different scripts ? from Latin letters to
libunistring: Chinese Hanzi ?, with many kinds of special characters ?
libunistring: accents, right-to-left writing marks, hyphens, Roman numbers,
libunistring: and much more. But the POSIX platform APIs for text do not
libunistring: contain adequate functions for dealing with particular
libunistring: properties of many Unicode characters. In fact, the POSIX APIs
libunistring: for text have several assumptions at their base which don't
libunistring: hold for Unicode text.

# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

sparsehash: 2 bits/entry overhead! The  SparseHash  library  contains  several
sparsehash: hash-map implementations, including implementations  that optimize

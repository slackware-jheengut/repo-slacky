# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

cogl: Cogl (GL/GLES Abstraction/Utility)
cogl:
cogl: Cogl is a modern 3D graphics API with associated utility APIs designed
cogl: to expose the features of 3D  graphics  hardware  using  a more object
cogl: oriented design than OpenGL. The library  has primarily been driven by
cogl: the practical needs of Clutter but  it  is not tied to any one toolkit
cogl: or even constrained to developing UI toolkits.

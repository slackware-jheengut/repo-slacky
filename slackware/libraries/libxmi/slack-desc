# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libxmi: GNU libxmi  is  a C/C++  function  library  for rasterizing 2-D vector
libxmi: graphics. It   can  draw 2-D   graphical   primitives, including  wide
libxmi: polygonal lines and circular and elliptical arcs, into a user-supplied
libxmi: matrix  of  pixels. Sophisticated  line  styles, such  as multicolored
libxmi: dashing patterns, can be specified. There is also  support for filling
libxmi: and texturing polygons.

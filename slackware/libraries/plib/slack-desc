# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

plib: PLIB (Portable Game Libraries)
plib:
plib: PLIB  includes  sound  effects,  music,  a complete 3D engine, font
plib: rendering, a simple Windowing library, a game scripting language, a
plib: GUI, networking, 3D math library and a  collection of handy utility
plib: functions. All are 100% portable across nearly all modern computing
plib: platforms. What's more, it's all available on line - and completely
plib: free. Each  library  component  is fairly independent of the others
plib: so if you want to use SDL, GTK, GLUT, or FLTK instead of 
plib: PLIB's 'PW' windowing library, you can.

# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

evolvotron: Evolvotron evolve  images/textures/patterns/animations  through  an
evolvotron: iterative  process  of  random  mutation  and user-selection driven
evolvotron: evolution. (This process is also often referred to as "evolutionary
evolvotron: art" or "genetic art".) If you like lava lamps, and still think the
evolvotron: Mandelbrot set is cool, this could be the software for you.

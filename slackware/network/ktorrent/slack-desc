# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

ktorrent: KTorrent is a BitTorrent program for KDE. BitTorrent is a protocol
ktorrent: for distributing files. Its advantage over plain HTTP is that when
ktorrent: multiple  downloads  of  the same  file  happen  concurrently, the
ktorrent: downloaders upload to each other, making it possible  for the file
ktorrent: source to support very large numbers of downloaders  with  only  a
ktorrent: modest increase in its load.

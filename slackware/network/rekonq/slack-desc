# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

rekonq:
rekonq: Rekonq is a KDE browser based on Webkit. Its code is based on Nokia

rekonq: to embrace KDE technologies to have a full-featured KDE web browser
rekonq: This software is the product of  my  playing to be a programmer, so
rekonq: the higher its quality is, the better I can play.. I've got lots of
rekonq: ideas to implement in it, so many features that I will like to have
rekonq: in my perfect browsers  Anyway,   rekonq   is  far from perfect. It

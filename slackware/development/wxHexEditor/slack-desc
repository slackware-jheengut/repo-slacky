# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

wxHexEditor: wxHexEditor is another hex tool writen with wx library. I built it
wxHexEditor: because there is no good  hex editor  for open  giant files and HD
wxHexEditor: drives. You can open file or  block  devices up to some exabyte in

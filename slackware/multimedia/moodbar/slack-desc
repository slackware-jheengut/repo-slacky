# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' 
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also customary
# to leave one space after the ':'.

moodbar: Moodbar (Audio Visual Analysis)
moodbar:
moodbar: The  Moodbar  is   an  algorithm  for  creating  a  colorful   visual
moodbar: representation of  the  contents of an audio file, giving an  idea of
moodbar: its "mood" (this is a rather fanciful  term for  the simple  analysis
moodbar: it actually does). The Moodbar was invented by Gavin  Wood  and Simon
moodbar: O'Keefe  for  inclusion  in  the  Amarok  music player.  This package
moodbar: contains  a  GStreamer  plugin  with  elements  that  are used in the
moodbar: moodbar analysis, and an application that actually does the analysis.

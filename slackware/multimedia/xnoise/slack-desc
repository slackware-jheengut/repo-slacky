# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

xnoise: XNoise (GTK2+ Media Player)
xnoise:
xnoise: XNOISE is a media player for Gtk+ with a slick GUI, great  speed and
xnoise: lots of features. Unlike Rhythmbox, Banshee or itunes, Xnoise uses a
xnoise: tracklist centric design. The tracklist  is a list of video or music
xnoise: tracks that are played one  by one without being removed (right side
xnoise: of window). This gives  you the possibility  to enqueue any track in
xnoise: any order, regardless  if they  are  on  the  same album or not. The
xnoise: tracks can be reordered at any time via drag and drop.

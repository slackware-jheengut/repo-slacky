# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

tellico: Tellico is  an KDE application  for keeping  track of your collections
tellico: It provides default templates for books, bibliographies, videos, music
tellico: coins,  stamps,  trading cards,  comic books,  and  wines.  Ultimately
tellico: I'd like it to  be similar in capability to AVCataloger or  Readerware
tellico: although it's still got a ways to go.

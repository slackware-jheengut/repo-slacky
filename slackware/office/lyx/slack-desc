# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

lyx: LyX (Qt4 WYSIWYM Document Processor)
lyx:
lyx: LyX is an advanced open source document processor running on many
lyx: Unix and some non-Unix platforms. It  is  called  a
lyx: "document processor",  because unlike  standard  word  processors,
lyx: LyX  encourages an approach to writing based on the structure of
lyx: your documents, not their appearance.
